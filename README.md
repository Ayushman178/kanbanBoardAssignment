In the project directory, run:
### `npm install`
npm install is a command used in Node.js and JavaScript projects to install dependencies, which are external packages or modules that the project relies on. When you run npm install in the terminal, npm (Node Package Manager) looks at the package.json file in the project's root directory to determine the list of dependencies and their versions.

### `npm run dev`
npm run dev is used to start a development server or initiate a development environment. It's often associated with running tasks that are helpful during the development phase of a project.
